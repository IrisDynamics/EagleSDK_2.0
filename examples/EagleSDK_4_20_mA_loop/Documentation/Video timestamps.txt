The set up in this video has motor 2's position output signal being used as the force control signal for motor 1. Motor 2 has a shorter shaft than Motor 1

Time 	- 	Description

0:00	- 	Two motors are connected (Green titles) 
		Motor 1
		Motor position at 0 (fully retracted)
		Ctrl current signal to motor 1 is 4mA (the PWM signal from motor 2 is producing this current)
		PWM duty cycle of motor 1 is at the value that will produce 4mA output (denominator 4096)
		Force Target is -5084 (-Force Gain) maximum negative value with current configuration due to 4mA ctrl signal
		Control State 2 means the motor 1 force is being directly controlled by the ctrl current
		Motor 2
		Motor position at 0 (fully retracted)
		There is no control signal being sent to motor 2
		PWM duty cycle of motor 1 is at the value that will produce 4mA output (denominator 4096)
		Force target 0, due to no current signal
		Control state 0, motor is asleep 

0:02-0:05	Motor 2 position starts to move, PWM Output from it increases resulting in the control current input signal to motor 1 increasing
		Once the motor 2 position reaches half o the maximum position, the output PWM signal results in a control current to motor 1 of 12 mA
		As the ctrl current signal increases from 4mA to 12mA the target force increases from -Force Gain to 0. With a force output of 0 the shaft
		can move freely with no resistance.

0:05-0:06	As Motor 2's position increasing past its halfway poitn the current control signal goes from 12mA - 16mA
		The force target is now positive so Motor 1 starts moving in the positive direction
		The PWM output from Motor 1 increases but then stops once its position passes the Max Position set in its configuration settings

0:06-0:08	Motor 2 continues to its fully extended position 
		Once the maximum position is reached, the ctrl current signal reaches 20mA and the force target becomes the positive Force Gain value. 
		Motor 1 extends to its maximum position of ~295mm

0:08-0:16	Motor 2 returns to its retracted position.  
		The ctrl current moves from 20mA to 4mA
		The force target move from maximum positive target to maximum negative.
		As the force target goes negative Motor 1 starts moving back to its zero(fully retracted) position

0:17-0:22	The Sleep Motor button is pressed. Putting the Motor 1 to sleep
		The ctrl current is still 4mA however the target force now becomes 0 
		Control state 0 

0:22-0:26	The ctrl current input is physically disconnected, ctrl current goes to 0mA

0:26-0:29	The ctrl current is reconnected, but still asleep due to sleep button

0:29-0:34	Sleep Motor button is toggled off
		Control State 1 force ramping
		Force ramps to the target values then enters Controls State 2

0:34-0:47	Motor 1 Max Position slider is moved to a new value and the Save Config button is pressed
		This updates the position range for the PWM Output - > output current signal
